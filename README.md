Passing arguments on Terminal
Write a Python program called create customer.py that everytime it is
executed, appends a new customer to a file passed as a program argu-
ment (e.g. customers.txt), containing a customer name and ID per line.
Your program should read the customer details (using input()), and write
those details into the specified file. Example execution:
$ python create customer.py customers.txt
Costumer name: John Smith
Costumer ID: 123
$ python create customer.py customers.txt
Costumer name: James Bond
Costumer ID: 007
